# What is this tool?

This tool displays an error if the Unity platform is not the specified one.

For example, have you ever been working with several people on a Unity project for WebGL application development, and one of the members of the team did not switch the Platform to WebGL, and you encountered a mysterious build error and spent a lot of time troubleshooting?

With this tool, if you forgot to Switch Platform, the error will be displayed and you will notice it immediately!

Please give it a try!
